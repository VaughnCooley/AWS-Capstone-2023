# AWS Capstone 2023

GitHub Repository for the AWS Capstone Project lab assignment. This documentation is for a proof-of-concept cloud infrastructure for an example university's web application.
Below is a complete documented process for creating this proof of concept design.

## Task 1: Planning
The planning phase required an outline of the cloud infrastructure and an esitmate of the monthly and annual cost of the services, provided in this case by the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/ "AWS Pricing Calculator"). Below is the cloud diagram outline (top) and AWS Pricing Calculator esitamte (bottom).
